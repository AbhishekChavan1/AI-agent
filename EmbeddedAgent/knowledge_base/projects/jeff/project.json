  "generated_code": "Here's a simple Arduino code that blinks an LED connected to pin 9:\n```cpp\n// Define the LED pin\nconst int ledPin = 9;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  // Initialize the LED pin as an output\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Turn the LED on\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);\n  // Wait for 1 second\n  delay(1000);\n  // Turn the LED off\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);\n  // Wait for 1 second\n  delay(1000);\n}\n```\nThis code uses the `digitalWrite` function to set the LED pin high (on) or low (off), and the `delay` function to pause the program for a specified amount of time. The `setup` function is called once at the beginning of the program, and the `loop` function is called repeatedly until the program is stopped.\n\nTo use this code, simply copy and paste it into the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and serial port, and upload it to your Arduino board. Make sure to connect the LED to the correct pin (in this case, pin 9) and add a resistor to limit the current.",
