# Project Overview
The LDS project is a simple Arduino-based LED control system.

## Hardware Requirements and Connections
* Arduino Board
* LED
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires

## Software Dependencies
* Arduino IDE

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the LED to the breadboard.
2. Connect the Arduino board to the computer.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.

## Usage Guide
1. Turn on the LED by setting the pin high.
2. Turn off the LED by setting the pin low.

## Troubleshooting Tips
* Check the connections.
* Check the code.
* Check the LED. 

Here's an example code to get you started:
```cpp
const int ledPin = 9;  // Choose the pin for the LED

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // Set the LED pin as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);  // Turn the LED on
  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn the LED off
  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second
}
```
This code will blink the LED connected to pin 9 on the Arduino board. Make sure to replace `9` with the actual pin number you're using.
