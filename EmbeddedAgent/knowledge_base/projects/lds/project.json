  "documentation": "# Project Overview\nThe LDS project is a simple Arduino-based LED control system.\n\n## Hardware Requirements and Connections\n* Arduino Board\n* LED\n* Breadboard\n* Jumper Wires\n\n## Software Dependencies\n* Arduino IDE\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Connect the LED to the breadboard.\n2. Connect the Arduino board to the computer.\n3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.\n\n## Usage Guide\n1. Turn on the LED by setting the pin high.\n2. Turn off the LED by setting the pin low.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n* Check the connections.\n* Check the code.\n* Check the LED. \n\nHere's an example code to get you started:\n```cpp\nconst int ledPin = 9;  // Choose the pin for the LED\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // Set the LED pin as an output\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);  // Turn the LED on\n  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn the LED off\n  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second\n}\n```\nThis code will blink the LED connected to pin 9 on the Arduino board. Make sure to replace `9` with the actual pin number you're using.",
